# Audio visualisation study
This repository contains source code for a browser-based study on audio visualisation. 

Study participants are presented with an interactive canvas 

# Set up
Install and launch JATOS on your machine, I recommend following the official guide:
http://www.jatos.org/Get-started.html

Download the zipped study package (this is the easiest way to add a study to JATOS).

On the JATOS homepage, click ''Import study'' and find the zipped package.

The study should appear in the left side-pane.

You can access the source code in ```[your JATOS installation folder]/study_assets_root```.

For the study to be functional, you need a dataset containing sample coordinates, audio envelopes, audio samples, and images. 
You can download our sample dataset from [this link]. Unzip the contents into ```[study source folder]/static/```. This dataset uses samples from the [nSynth dataset] and contains ~800 samples of various instruments all playing midi note 64 at 75 velocity.
